# Kirby CMS KirbyBox Theme V1.0

Kirby CMS: <https://getkirby.com>

It's my second kirby theme. First one is [Clean Blog](#). You can download it [here](https://github.com/alkinkasap/Clean-Blog-Kirby-Theme).

# Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

## The Panel

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel.

When you go for panel you will be creating a new user.

## Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**

## Trial

This theme is free and you may use it for anything. However a reference link would be appreciated.
You can try Kirby on your local machine or on a test server as long as you need to make sure it is the right tool for your next project. It's better to check for Kirby's license terms below.

## Buy a license

You can purchase your Kirby license at
<https://getkirby.com/buy>

A Kirby license is valid for a single domain. You can find
Kirby's license agreement here: <https://getkirby.com/license>

### Requirements

Kirby runs on PHP 5.3+, Apache or Nginx.

## Documentation

For Kirby CMS refer to:
<https://getkirby.com/docs/guide>

Almost everything in the theme is dynamic. Documentation would take too long but it will be good to make it clear on some functions.
First social links are dynamic and you can hide them.
Second, every page has background image function. If you upload an image named background it will be used instead of *site* background image.  
Contact page works on formspree. It's a free service until you got 1000 email contacts a month (if you get more than one-thousand, well you should go premium.). Anti-spam input added on page. You can check [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io).
Home page has 8 projects limit and portfolio page doesn't have any limitation.
On site page please refer to tags that will be used on menu of portfolio page. Also you should add tags to every portfolio item separately to make menu work as you need.
